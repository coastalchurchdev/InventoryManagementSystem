# CPSC445Capstone
This is my git repository for my capstone project. Please be aware that this is an activly working direcotry, so please be weary of any potential bugs that may arise. 

# Executive Summary
Managing a large pool of equipment is a challenge especially if you are a small organization.  You may find yourself having to share resources, but when that happens, there is possibility of non-communication in terms of borrowing of equipment. In an effort to remedy this, this project seeks to develop a new platform for easier management of your resources without at the same time-wasting time. Never wonder where that tripod is, with this tool, you will always know where your gear is!

# Introduction
The focus of this project is to develop an inventory management system to aid in the tracking of equipment through an organization. The reason this project has been developed is due to an uncertainty of where equipment is, and who is utilizing said equipment. An inventory management system is perhaps the best way to address this. 

# Project Background
For background, I work in a production setting working on projects that require a great deal of equipment. In the past, the size of the organization was seen as being small enough that it wasnâ€™t a major concern, however, with the size of departments growing, a need had to be met to ensure that expensive equipment did not simply disappear. The goal is to utilize teachings and understandings from classes such as CPSC 350 & 351 to help mold this final project considering they revolved around very similar ideas. 

# Project Description
The desired resulting project is to have a simple to use system that will allow for members of an internal team to know where certain items are located as well as to log when they may need to utilize a certain piece of equipment. One of the easiest ways to do this would be to utilize a barcode scanner. The goal is for this project to make communication between organization departments run smoother. Because this is an internal application, it is best that I approach this with a web application. This would allow for users to log into a portal to view what is available, even when not in the office.

# Conclusion
This project seeks to foster better communication when it comes to inter departmental sharing of resources. Utilizing a web interface, accessible from any computer, this tool seeks to foster efficiency at every level. I see this project taking about 9 weeks to develop and bring to completion. My only area of concern is the process of logging all the inventory that I wish to keep a record of being how time consuming this is. However, if that proves to be an issue, I can perhaps add merely test data in the meantime, and upon official deployment, begin the tedious task of logging everything.
